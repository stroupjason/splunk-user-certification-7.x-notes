    - establish that it's not an application error
    - go throught the SQL logs found a slow query making it for some clients difficult to complete their transactions. 9 hours had passed, not a great scenario with one issue.
  - How do you solve this in less time?
    - find the event in elastic search or kibana logging xml or json logs and find the event that's tied to a db query which is correlated to the entry in the slow query log in a matter of minutes and only impacting a developer's help
    - pin point, correlate, and pinpoint these events to stay ahead of the curve and alert the support team before the client even writes into support
